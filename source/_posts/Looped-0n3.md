**My brain feels like it’s bleeding dreams.**

Desperate to escape the heartache of my Tokyo Bell breakup, I sought refuge at Antics. I craved the sweet noise, the pulse of electro energy shot straight into my spine. Something to numb the pain. The lights went out,  the figure 0n stage began to project.The afterglow produced by the chemicals used to isolate the Neuromate Hub made everything shine bright neon blue. 

Yiulee began his set, a blend of Neo-Tibetan ambient house with classic space metal. But as lights flickered, I sensed a shift. The transmissions invaded my mind, projecting emotions like a faulty tape reel, a badly recorded analog dream. The monitors began projecting his thoughts and memories.

Yiulee used this set to evoke anxiety and guilt. I guess he got to me. He manipulated my psyche, adding layers of feelings and thoughts until I was ready to smash something with my baseball bat. But then, in a cruel twist, he yanked away the guilt and replaced it with soul-crushing sorrow, wrenching my heart from my chest and plunging it into a spiral of darkness. 

My soul gave a j0lt. I felt it at the center of my brain, like it had been violently fished out of my body and flushed down a spiral. The warning was clear: do not neurally connect when unstable. But it was too late. A surge coursed through my body, frying my synapses and leaving me lost in a perpetual cycle of thought. Now, I am forgotten, trapped in a haunting loop. My mind is a bleeding canvas. **My brain feels 1ike it’s bleeding dreams**…
