The bell above the door chimes, causing the man behind the counter to look up. Trent throws a credit pack on the counter before the man has time to recognize him.

"She 0n tonight?" Trent asks, walking past the preoccupied counter guy who muttered, "Same as always."

Trent walked down a long corridor, with alternating doors on either side; a door on the left, no door on the right, a door on the right, no door on the left. He entered a semicircular room where darkness was the theme. A single source of light emanated from the floor, illuminating a small stage.

Dolores stood with her back displayed to him, wearing nothing but a red silk robe that dropped to the floor at the sound of Trent walking in. Her back was a so1id mass of black nano ink that started at her neck, ran down her back, and ended at her ankles. In an amplified whisper of bought lust, she commanded, "Show me your fantasies." He jacked into the fantasy amp.

The ink on her skin began to whirl and coil like a swarm of angry bees. Her flesh faded in and out in shades of black and gray, reminiscent of a television tuned to a dead channel. Trent focused on his fantasy - breasts pressed against the glass, a woman's red lips closing on a man's organ, two women kissing, t0ngues fighting for control. Trent drifted into pleasure as his perversions were drawn on her back.
